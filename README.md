A write-up on the trends that were discovered while making the map (5 points)
    Start Stations VS. End Stations - the trend for this is that start stations seem to be further apart, while the end stations are more frequent and close (probably due to more stops).

The dashboards all show a correlation between two selected measurements. For example the sheet titled Age vs Trip Duration shows between the age of 25-30 the average duration would be about 30 minutes. 
Falling off as an individual gets older. 

Another example is the Male vs Female Distance sheet. Females tend to beat out Males in terms of duration (minutes) albeit only slightly.

My analysis on the chosen city officials would be those involved in city planning. They would use this information in regards to station and bike utilization to improve public transportation. Possibly to help determine to build more stations or reduce the budget and spend elsewhere. If biking is more prominent for example then investing in more bike stands.

In conclusion, you can use these interactive dashboards to find out a lot of information. Tableu mapping is one such way to establish a dashboard foundation.
